PdfBox-Android
==============

A port of Apache's PdfBox library to be usable on Android. Most features should be implemented by now. If you find any issues or want to request a feature that you need for your project, please use the issue tracker. Stable releases can be added as a Gradle by declaring ``` com.tom_roush:pdfbox-android:1.8.9.0 ``` as a dependency with jcenter set as a repository. The latest releases can be built by cloning the repo and running Gradle. The tasks for building are set as default, so running ```gradlew.bat``` or ```./gradlew``` will take care of all necessary tasks.
